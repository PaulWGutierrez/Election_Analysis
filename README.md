# Election Analysis
### Overview of Election Audit
#### The main objective of the election analysis is to report the total number of votes recorded, the total number of votes for each candidate and county, the percentage of votes for each candidate and county, as well as the winning candidate of the election based upon the popular vote. All the voting will be done using one of three primary voting methods which are mail-in ballots, punch cards and Direct Recording Electronic (DRE counting machines). The three voting methods will be taken into account to get the election results.

### Election Analysis Summary
#### This script can be modified in several ways in regards to elections. One of the ways it could be modified is by getting data of the ages of the people that voted to see a trend, as well as getting the locations within counties, cities, regions etc., of where a particular age group had an impact on the votes. Another example that could be done regarding this script and doing a modification for other elections is to research the data of how the people voted. Obtaining data on whether a person voted in person, by mail, virtually or other voting methods could help with the candidates' campaigns in future elections. Using this data the candidate and his or her team could find out what would be the best and most productive way to promote and to reach out the most people possible.
